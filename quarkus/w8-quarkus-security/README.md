Not sure if I did something wrong but the form auth does not fully work for me
- redirect from `secret` to `/` does not work for me.

Why fight the framework when can roll out own auth simply and easily the only challenge will be oauth
which might have to find some lightweight library for ... if decide to roll out oauth.
