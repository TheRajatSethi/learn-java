# Features to implement

Wish to implement the following features
- Eviction depending on following policies  
  - LRU
- Cache Stats
- Async loading

Executor service is used for some of the above to be implemented


# Inspiration

There are various cache implementations of java which can provide inspirations such as 
- guava cache (I think this might be a simple one to take inspiration from)
- caffeine
  - Take a look at two packages which this uses especially the checker framework (might be good to take a look at)
- ehcache3
