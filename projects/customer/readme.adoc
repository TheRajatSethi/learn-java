= Customer Project

== Overview

The project is made to mimic what I do in cif, but is sort of a learning exercise.

== Services

* CoreCustomerService
- SpringBoot based REST Service
- Create Customer => Calls matching service to make sure duplicates are not created.
- Get Customers Details

* CustomerMatchingService
- GRPC based service
- Rule Engine ??


== Tech Stack

Some services are implemented using SpringBoot and some using Javalin so that can learn both ways of doing things.

== Parent Pom vs Starter Project
