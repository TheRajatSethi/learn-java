= Customer Project

== Overview

The project is made to mimic what I do in cif, but is sort of a learning exercise. Thus take this as a learning exercise and do the same thing multiple ways e.g.

- For inbound payload you can use hibernate validation or not use and do own validation.
- Use Spring Modulith to structure code or don't use spring modulith and use own.
- For events use Kafka, Rabbit MQ or use table and own queue
- For api registration you can use Consul with service discovery or put NGNIX in front and not use service discovery etc...
- Use Spring for some services, Use Javalin for some services
- ...

== Dependencies Setup

*Java*

- Java 24/25

*POSTGRES*

[,sh]
----
docker pull postgres:alpine

docker run -d --name customer-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -v postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:alpine

----
Connect to psql with some user `postgres`
`psql -U postgres`

Create a database with customer
create database customer;

Switch to customer database
\c customer;

Create Schema for the ServiceCustomerCore
create schema servicecustomercore;


----

== Tech Stack

- Java
- SpringBoot
- Javalikn

Some services are implemented using SpringBoot and some using Javalin so that can learn both ways of doing things.

== Parent Pom vs Starter Project
