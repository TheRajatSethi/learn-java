= Maven

Its a `declarative` project build automation build tool such as gradle. `Ant` was imperative and was first to arrive at the scene
- code compilation
- tests
- dependency import
- executable file creation
- ...

Its written in java, primarily for java.

`pom.xml` project object model file is a file containing all configuration of the project. At the end `maven` produces a artifact which can be ear, war, jar executable file which is stored in `target/` directory.

== Important Tags

- `groupId` - reverse name of website
- `artifactId` - name of project
- `version` - version of project
- `packaging`
	- jar - java archive
	- war - web archive
	- ear - enterprise archive
	- pom - this project has no source code, mostly used in multimodule builds where the parent pom is just used to configure dependencies, versions for all modules. (Mostly dependencyManagemnet & pluginManagement). Then these dependencies and plugins are used in module level pom files if they want to be used there.
- `properties` - most commonly used to keep versions of dependencies
- `repositories` - by default maven downloads all dependencies from maven central which is defined in the super pom - which also stores the project structure etc...
	- however you can have custom repositories
- `dependencies` - used to declare dependencies
	- scope - on which stage of project this library is allowed to work 
		- compile - (**default**) - allowed on all stages
		- provided - code compilation & test e.g. lombok, not be included in java archive file.
		- runtime - allowed in runtime & test stage, now allowed on compilation - e.g. jdbc
		- test - compile and runtime on tests - not included in jar
	- transitive dependency - its a dependency which is included by your dependency
	- `build`
		- `plugins`


== Maven Lifecycle

Maven has 3 lifecycles, lifecycle can have phases in it e.g. default has multiple phases in it. 

. site - creates a website with info about project. This will create a `site` folder in `target` and you can browse details of your project. `mvn site`. Gives you a nice view of your project
. clean - removes `target/` folder
. default (Has many phases - which are part of a lifecycle)
.. compile - compiles source code, evals all .java files and moves to target.
.. test-compile - same as compile but for test folder
.. tests - run tests
.. package - packages compiled project files into executables
.. install - puts executable into local repository where it can be imported by local projects
.. deploy - copies executable to remote repo for sharing with developers

Phases are consecutive (order as below). Lets say if you run `install` it will run all the above phases in the default lifecycle

- validate
- compile
- test
- package
- verify
- install
- deploy

You can skip a phase though e.g. `mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true` if you'd like.

== Maven Goals

- Its a unit of work
- In most cases goals are linked to phases.
- Every goal runs with a specified plugin e.g. compiler plugin runs goals *compile* & *test compile*
- Example goals `<name of plugin : goal>`. You can run this e.g. `mvn compiler:compile`
	- resources : resources
	- compiler : compile
	- resources : testRespuces
	- compiler : testCompile
	- surefire : test
	- jar : jar
	- install : install
	- deploy : deploy

== Maven Plugins
- Its a java class assembled in a special way which runs goals.
- Every plugin contains its own goals which can be executed with only this plugin
- Plugins directory https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin[Apache Maven PMD Plugin â€“ Introduction]
- To configure plugins you have to put those options in the `build` part of the pom.xml or in cmd line arguments. (Easier in pom.xml as its used forever then)

== Maven Profiles
Set of configurations which rewrites the project based on selected profile e.g. different operating system.

[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
	<profile>
		<id>production</id>
	</profile>
</profiles>
----

So when you run mvn command specify the profile `mvn -Pproduction package` where production is the name of the profile.
Profile can also have activators which will trigger profile automatically based on conditions.

[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
	<profile>
		<id>production</id>
		<activation>
			<activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault> <!-- There are other activators as well. -->
		</activation>
	</profile>
</profiles>
----

== Multi-module project
- Mostly the parent will have packaging  = pom
- Module pom inherit from parent pom
- Its important to have executable files of modules as light as possible - just import what you need.

Best practices
- Use dependency management
- Use plugin management

== Commands

- `mvn site` - creates a site about your project
- `mvn package` - packages project based on packaging instruction in the pom
